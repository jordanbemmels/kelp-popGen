# Coastline rasters

These rasters were used for calculating the geographic distance 'as the kelp floats' (i.e., the least-cost distance travelled by ocean) between kelp populations. Each pixel in the the southern BC and Washington raster represents one millidegree, whereas in the northern BC raster each pixel represents two millidegrees.

Note that some small areas of the rasters have been modified by hand to convert non-ocean pixels to ocean pixels. The purpose of this was to ensure that all kelp populations occurred in ocean pixels, and to ensure that narrow ocean passages were fully open to dispersal by kelp.

Rasters were generated from a polygon of the BC and partial Washington coastline:
