# Realized load of simulated crosses

These scripts calculate realized genetic load of individuals generated from simulated crosses between and within populations.

### getGTs_ancDer_GERP.R

This *R* script prints and pre-processes the genotypes for all individuals in each population, converting genotypes to [0, 1, 2] format indicating the number of copies of the derived allele.
