# Purging and drift

These scripts calculate allele frequencies by population in different site categories, which are needed to statistically test the predictions of purging and genetic drift.

### purging_drift_GERP.R

This *R* script calculates the allele frequencies for evolutionarily labile and evolutionarily conserved sites, from the GERP analysis.

### purging_drift_SnpEff.R

This *R* script calculates the allele frequencies for modifier and low-, moderate-, and high-impact sites, from the SnpEff analysis.
